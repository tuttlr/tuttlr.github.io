        <p>Hello! As a soon-to-be graduate from Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology in May 2025 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a Minor in Artificial Intelligence, 
            I am eager to continue my professional journey in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.  From the get-go, I embraced the challenge of balancing rigorous academic pursuits with 
            meaningful professional experiences, beginning my journey into the world of internships right from my freshman year.  This early immersion into the professional world has not only 
            complemented my academic learning but has provided a practical backdrop to my theoretical studies and shaped me into the person I am today.

            Beyond textbooks and tech, I enjoy traveling, volunteering at barns teaching disabled children horseback riding, and sharing my love for programming with elementary school children. As a
            horseback riding regional champion, I have learned the value of patience, perserverance, and leadership. Competing has shaped me into a strong and dedicated person with a passion for succeeding
            at the things I love. I am on a journey to make an impact and use my passion for Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence to contribute positively to something I believe in.
